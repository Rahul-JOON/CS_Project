# Tank_Busters - Summer_CS_Project

## Introduction
  - This is a replica attempt of the online game - [Tank Trouble](https://tanktrouble.com/)
  - The project is a two player game in which the player controls a tank and destroys the other player in a randomly generated maze. The name of the game is tank busters and is played on a single computer. Once the bullet of either of the tanks hits the other, the game is over and the other player wins.
  - The source of our idea is that we both are gaming enthusiasts and were interested in developing a game which we used to play with our friends.
